Our Project Title is Covid-19
We used 3 dataset in csv format. 
2 sets are of Covid-19
Third set is of International Arrival, and this dataset is used for answering the relationship question between International Arrivals with the spread of Covid-19
We have cleaned the data before using.
Through Compairson graph, We find out USA is the most effected country.
Afterwards we found the 10 most worst effected countries using nlargest()function based on total number of cases and deaths.
With this dataset we found the correlation between International arrivals and the spread of Covid-19.
We found a positive relation between them. It more likely the spread of Covid will increase with the International arrivals.
Linear regression is the method we next found to predict the spread in USA. 
Model shows the spread is likely to increase in USA.
We found a high r2scores and accuracy for the model.
